# Paper draft

## Current stage

- Bonan finished the first complete draft
- Chris has looked at the intro paragraphs at the modeling section
- Neil has looked at the PCFG part of the modeling section
- **Priority: Chris to have a look at the DP part of the modeling section?**


## Model fitting results

|                 | $\alpha$ | $\beta$ | $t$   | Log likelihood | BIC        |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-------|----------------|------------|
| Random baseline |          |         |       | -3955          | 7910       |
| Universal model |          |         | 6.96  | -2761          | 5529       |
| DPG model       | 2.41     | 938.81  | 9.44  | -2748          | 5518       |
| Process model   | 0.38     | 1       | 10.09 | **-2736**      | **5494**   |


## New figs
- I made a new table for exp 1 generalization trials
- Exp 1 model prediction plot
- Exp 2 model prediction plot

## Unsure
- Check trial stats?
- Intro & discussion points
- (Minor: merge .tex files into one?)


# New project ideas

- Program induction of causal knowledge
- Multiple ground truth
- Change of feature as hint for causal learning
- Iterative learning

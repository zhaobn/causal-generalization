"1","If the active stone is a pentagon or hexagon, it will change the change of the square (inactive stone) to a shape with one more side than the active stone. If the active stone has more sides than the inactive stone, it will increase the number of sides on the inactive stone.","10","0","23","male","10","7","Fun experiment. Would love to see more like this!","A2","2020_10_08","15_25_53",219909,247850,"H7WAP2RK",8

"3","The active stone turns the inactive stone into a pentagon if it is not already a pentagon and turns it into a darker shade of blue.","10","1","27","male","10","9","This was an interesting thought experiment, I'm not even sure if I was right or not.","A1","2020_10_08","16_36_37",197138,524957,"S4APB968",12
"4","If pentagon hits square it becomes hexagon and if hexagon hits square then it becomes heptagon. If triangle hits square it remains same but change in color shape.","8","0","39","female","10","4","None","A2","2020_10_08","18_42_48",270792,756860,"G4SROT3A",6
"5","The active stone turns all the inactive stones into pentagons regardless of the original shape of the inactive stone, and it darkens the color of the inactive stone by one shade.","10","0","26","male","3","0","No.","A1","2020_10_08","20_37_22",87332,318029,"W0LN32CW",10

"7","When hit by an active shape, inactive shapes increase the amount of sides that shape has by one, except when hit by a triangle; further, the inactive shape always goes darker by one hue. ","10","0","25","male","10","3","n/a ","A2","2020_10_08","22_08_27",121315,401691,"UL5TROHP",4
"8","First I think that active stones change all the stones it comes into contact with but depends on what the shape is to how it changes. For example when it hits a six sided shape it always turns into a 5 sided shape. When it hits a 3 sided shape it always turns into a 5 sided shape. Also whatever color the inactive stone was  when it was hit always changes into a darker shade regardless of the shapes. Also whenever an active stone hits a 5 sided shape it always stays the same. ","10","0","33","female","10","7","I would like to know the truth about the way the stones acted.","A1","2020_10_08","21_02_13",163793,745585,"XYVDDA7F",9
"9","the inactive stone will become a pentagon when near a glowing stone.  In addition, it will darken a bit.","10","0","38","male","5","3","I have nothing to add.","A1","2020_10_08","24_27_30",294551,416992,"WIC0A3FP",10

          On a recent astrological field trip, space scientists discovered curious stones with mysterious powers unlike anything seen on Earth!
          The stones do not all look the same and this seems determine how they interact with one another 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The stones stones discovered so far seem to come in a range of shades including some that are:
            <span style="color: #c9daf8; font-weight: bold;">light</span>,
            <span style="color: #6d9eeb; font-weight: bold;">medium</span>,
            <span style="color: #1155cc; font-weight: bold;">dark</span>, to
            <span style="color: #1c4587; font-weight: bold;">very dark</span>.
          </li>
          <li>And to come in a variety of shapes with different numbers of sides -
            triangular <svg height="20px" width="20px"><polygon fill="#1155cc" points="10,0 20,20 0,20"></polygon></svg>,
            square <svg height="20px" width="20px"><polygon fill="#1155cc" points="10,20 0,10 10,0 20,10"></polygon></svg>,
            pentagon <svg height="20px" width="20px"><polygon fill="#1155cc" points="13,20 2,16 2,4 13,0 20,10"></polygon></svg>,
            hexagon <svg height="20px" width="20px"><polygon fill="#1155cc" points="15,19 5,19 0,10 5,1 15,1 20,10"></polygon></svg>,
            etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sometimes the stones go into an active state in which they glow with a strange light
          IMAGE OF HEAVY CIRCLE INDICATING AN AGENT STONE

          When an <b>Active stone</b> is tapped against another (inactive) stone, the properties of the inactive stone often seem to change.
          <!-- Let's call the one touching the others the <b>agent</b>, and the one being touched the <b>recipient</b>.
          Precisely, <b>an agent stone can set color shading and/or shape of an recipient into specific states</b>.
          NB: I don't think we can say this, it gives the answer away!
          ALSO I think we can reserve Agent and Recipient for the paper not for the participants since they're a bit technical sounding--> 
        </p>
        <p>Any of the mysterious stones can be active or inactive.</p>
        <p>You are part of this scientific team to come up with theories about what determines these changes.</p>
        <p>
          Your task will have three phases:
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, you will observe HOWMANY test interactions between Active and Inactive stones.
              <div id="instruction-demo-display">
                <svg height="50px" width="50px"><polygon fill="#c9daf8" stroke-width="4px" stroke="#BDBDBD" points="25,5 45 25, 25,45 5,25"></polygon></svg>
                <svg height="50px" width="50px"><polygon fill="#6d9eeb" stroke-width="0px" points="25,5 45 25, 25,45 5,25"></polygon></svg>
              </div>
              You can click the "Play" button to watch the phenomena play out as many times as you like. After the effects are played, you will see a summary showing what the <b>Active stone</b> looked like and what the <b>Inactive stone</b> looked like <i>before</i> the Active stone hit it, and again <i>after</i> the Active stone hit it</b>.
            </li>
            <li>Then, you will be asked to write your initial impression of how the phenomena works.  What is it about the Active stone and the Inactive stone that makes the changes you observed occur? What changes would you expect for other pairs of Active and Inactive stones that might look different to these ones?</li>
            <li>
              Finally, you will see several new pairs of active stones and make a guess about what the inactive stone will look like after being hit by the Active stone.
              <!-- You will be able to select how you think the Inactive stone will look using drop-down menus. -->
              <!-- NB: I actually think we should get these generalisations before the free responses maybe? so its clearer that they have to answer for the general case not just the specific one -->
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>While making these predictions, the summaries you saw earlier will be still be shown at the top of the page. Please free feel to scroll up if you need to consult them.</p>
        <p>Think carefully. Your predictions are important for science!</p>
        <!-- I wonder if we can incentivise? Or say we'll incentivise? Since we want people to try and it might feel like they can write whatever they like with no consequence -->

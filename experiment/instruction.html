        <p>Scientists just discovered some unusual stones from an expedition. When one of these stones touches another, it may cause the touched stone to change.</p>
        <p>Changing stones to certain forms can be very useful for an important research project. Therefore, scientists want to understand how the changes work, i.e., which properties of the stones cause what effects.</p>
        <p>What scientists already know about these unusual stones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All the stones are colored by one or two of these colors:
            <span style="color: #558B2F; font-weight: bold;">dark green</span>,
            <span style="color: #8BC34A; font-weight: bold;">light green</span>,
            <span style="color: #EF6C00; font-weight: bold;">dark orange</span>,
            <span style="color: #FF9800; font-weight: bold;">light orange</span>.
          <li>Some stones have stripes - could be
            north-east pointed <div class="feedback-stone" style="display: inline-block; height: 20px; width: 20px; margin: 0; background: repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, #558B2F, #558B2F 5px, #8BC34A 5px, #8BC34A 10px);"></div>,
            or north-west pointed <div class="feedback-stone" style="display: inline-block; height: 20px; width: 20px; margin: 0; background: repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, #558B2F, #558B2F 5px, #8BC34A 5px, #8BC34A 10px);"></div>;
            some are plain <div class="feedback-stone" style="display: inline-block; height: 20px; width: 20px; margin: 0; background: #558B2F;"></div>.</li>
          <li>The one that touches is the <b>Agent</b> of the change, and the one being touched is always the <b>Recipient</b>. Agent and Recipient can be any stones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are in this scientific team to determine which properties of the stones cause what effects. Your colleagues have prepared some samples for your investigation. In these samples, <b>Agent is always on the left, and the Recipient is always on the right.</b></p>
        <p>Firstly, we will observe 9 samples made from different pairs of stones. You can watch the effects by clicking the `Play` button next to each sample.</p>
        <p>Please write down your conjecture of which properties of the stones cause what effects after observing each sample. You can use the provided `copy` and `paste` buttons to avoid typing the same thing multiple times.</p>
        <p>Then, your colleague will test how good you are by giving you three test samples. In these test samples, you will see pairs of Agents and Recipients, and you need to make a prediction of what the result is by selecting in the panel on the right-hand side of the screen.</p>
        <p>After that, you will have a chance to work with some newly-discovered unusual stones. We ask you to predict what the effects would be according to the causal explanations you came up with. You will get feedback after making each prediction, and you may update your working hypothesis alongside.</p>
        <p>When you feel like understanding the tasks, please proceed to the comprehension questions.</p>
